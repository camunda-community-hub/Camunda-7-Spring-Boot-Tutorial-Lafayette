# Camunda Platform 7 Spring Boot Tutorial Lafayette
This project is used as part of a video tutorial in order to show how you can use various features of Camunda 7 in a spring boot application.
Be aware that this is specific to Camunda 7 and concepts described here are not compatible with Camunda Platform 8.

## What is this all about?
When creating example projects I like to ensure that the examples I use are as close to real world use cases as possible and so in this example we'll be building a process in which we can help one of my favourite historical figures [Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_Lafayette) to do what he does best - get involved in revolutions! 

This is broken up into 4 parts and in the end we're looking a process that will help Lafayette with a more efficient way to ruin things for the French and British monarchy.

## What you will need 
* [Java JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) so that you can run the Camunda Platform
* [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) for building and deploying BPMN Models
* An integrated development environment for Java like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) 

## What will you learn?
* How to setup a spring boot project with Camunda
* Understanding the components of the project
* How to create forms and link them to user tasks
* How to write java classes that can be run by Service Tasks
* How to configure an XOR gateway based on process data
* How to configure non-interrupting timer events
* How to trigger and catch BPMN errors thrown from Java Code
